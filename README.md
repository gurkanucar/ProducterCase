# Producter Test Case

#### Requirements:

Spring Boot application with maven should be developed to handle the following specifications using GraphQL. Imagine that the application is basketball player registration for a basketball team. A Player can be added, deleted and also all players in the system can be listed.

- Please write 2 mutations and 1 query to complete specifications.
- 1 mutation for single player add.
- 1 mutation for single player delete.
- 1 query is for listed all basketball players in the system.
- Player has name, surname and position.
- Positions for Player
    - Point guard(PG),
    - Shooting guard(SG),
    - Small forward(SF),
    - Power forward(PF),
    - Center(C)
- Please consider input validation especially for mutation services.
- Please consider that a basketball team has maximum capacity during implementation.
- Please use a relational database, it could be MySQL. You can use Spring boot with H2 Database to demonstrate and test your proof of concept.
- Please write a unit test with any test framework, JUnit is enough for us.
- Please send your codes via any public repository which is located on Github or Bitbucket.
